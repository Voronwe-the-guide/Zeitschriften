For building the Software, Qt 5.15 is needed, which can be got from here: https://www.qt.io/download

Take in account the following:
https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-requirements.html

Additionally, OpenSSL is needed (I used 1.1.1g-win64-mingw.zip), which can be downloaded here: https://bintray.com/vszakats/generic/download_file?file_path=openssl-1.1.1g-win64-mingw.zip

Or here: https://kb.firedaemon.com/support/solutions/articles/4000121705 (This one is attached to the code)

Beside this, I would like you to ask to use this software only in good mood and not for purposes which could harm people, animals, magical creatures or the environment.
